      <h1>Rebekkah Porter</h1>
      <p>
        I am from a small town in Northern Indiana. I have a bachelor's degree in English lit, but I've worked in Operations most of my adult life. In retail, banking, and most recently, higher ed. I am a creative person--writing, painting, drawing--but my background in operations also has made me an orderly person (in general). Coding seems to combine those two "branches" of my personality.
